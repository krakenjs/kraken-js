## The Kraken Suite
KrakenJS is part of the Kraken Suite. If you'd like to find out more about the other modules, please visit [krakenjs.com](http://krakenjs.com)


## Getting Started

To create a new project:

1. Install Yeoman and the Kraken Generator:
`npm install -g generator-kraken`
2. Generate a Kraken project:
`yo kraken`
3. Go to your project directory and start your project. By default, it will listen on port 8000:
`npm start`


## Directory structure

- **/config** - Application and middleware configuration
- **/controllers** - Controllers
- **/lib** - Custom developer libraries and other code
- **/locales** - Local-based content
- **/models** - Models
- **/public** - Web resources that are publicly available
- **/public/templates** - Server and browser-side templates
- **/tests** - Unit and functional test cases



## Configuration

Configuration is stored in JSON format. Each settings file can be overridden in development mode by creating a `-development` version, e.g. app-development.json.

- **/config/app.json** - Application specific settings
- **/config/middleware.json** - Custom middleware specific settings

### Using custom configuration
If you'd like to add your own configuration to these files, simply include a new key.
To retrieve it in your application, you can do so during the [configuration step](#application-life-cycle-middleware)

## Customization


### Application Life-cycle (Middleware)

You can customize your application's life-cycle by adding methods to the app delegate in the `index.js` file. This is the ideal place to apply any middleware you might want to use in your application.

- **app.configure(config, next)** - Run on startup. `next` must be called to continue. *Make any changes to your config here.*
- **app.requestStart(server)** -  Run before most middleware has been registered. *Logging and other middleware that need to see every single request should get applied here.* 
- **app.requestBeforeRoute(server)** - Run before the routes have been added. *Most of your middleware should be applied in this function.*
- **app.requestAfterRoute(server)** - Run after the routes have been added. *Useful for adding error handling middleware.*

*Example 1: Retrieving custom configuration*

```javascript
app.configure = function configure(nconf, next) {
    // Fired when an app configures itself
    // Retrieve a custom key from ./config/middleware.json or ./config/app.json
    console.log('My custom config is: ', nconf.get('myCustomKey'));
};
```

*Example 2: Using middleware*

```javascript
app.requestBeforeRoute = function (server) {
    // Register passport-js middleware
    server.use(passport.initialize());
    server.use(passport.session());
};
```

*Example 3: Setting Locals for dustjs*

```javascript
app.requestBeforeRoute = function (server) {
    // Set locals which can be accessed in  dust template
    server.use(function(req,res,next){
        res.locals.whatever = "whatever you need or from nconf";
        //use {whatever} in dust template
        next();
    });
};
```

For more information about where to apply your middleware you may want to review http://expressjs.com/guide.html#error-handling.

### Routes

To add a route you need to create a new file in `/controllers` that exports a function which accepts an express server. From there it's all [express](http://expressjs.com/)!

*Example:*

```
module.exports = function (server) {
    server.get('/path', function (req, res) {
    	// Awesome code!
    });
};
```



## Content


### Format

Content is in key value format. Named variables may be inserted into content strings with `{bracket}` syntax using the name of the value in your data model.

*Example:*

```
myPage.title=Welcome to my site!
myPage.greeting=Hello, {user}. How are you?
```


### File Structure

Content is loaded from country and language subdirectories inside `/locales` based on the user locale. Convention is used to automatically determine which content file to load: the base template file name and path are looked for in the locales folder.

*Example:*

```
content/
  US/
    en/
      index.properties
      myDir/
         page.properties

public/
  templates/
    index.dust
    myDir/
      page.dust
```



## Builds

A [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) task is used for builds. To prepare your code for production run `grunt build` which will create new files in the `.build` directory. This task must be done before running your app in production mode.

## File upload

Support for [multipart forms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_select) is disabled by default. You can enable it by populating "multipart" in middleware.json and optionally pass parameters using [formidable's API](https://github.com/felixge/node-formidable).

Files uploaded in a given request will populate in `req.files`.

All temporary files uploaded will be automatically removed when the request is completed if you do not remove them yourself.

# Contributing to the Kraken Suite

1. Fork it.
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b fix-for-that-thing`)
3. Commit a failing test (`git commit -am "adds a failing test to demonstrate that thing"`)
3. Commit a fix that makes the test pass (`git commit -am "fixes that thing"`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin fix-for-that-thing`)

Please keep your branch up to date by rebasing upstream changes from master.


## FAQ

### Why use Kraken?
Kraken is the glue to your open source. It sits on top of grunt and express, but offers you a more robust feature set in a web application framework. The benefits include support for externalized content, localization, compile-on-the-fly editing, environment-based configuration, baked-in application security and more.

### How do I run in production mode?
Build your project first and then `export NODE_ENV=production` before running the app.

### How to opt out of view rendering
If your application does not require template rendering, you can disable it via your `./config/app.json` file by setting the following values to *null*:

```javascript
  "view engines": null,
  "express": {
    "view engine": null
  }
```
